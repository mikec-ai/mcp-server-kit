## What Worked Exceptionally Well

### 1. Project Scaffolding ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Command:** `mcp-server-kit new server --name code-snippet-library --template cloudflare-remote`

**Experience:**
- Instant project creation with complete structure
- All configuration files properly set up
- Example tools (health, echo) provided clear patterns
- README included "For AI Agents" section (highly valuable!)

**Agent Benefit:**
- Zero setup friction - I could immediately start implementing logic
- No need to configure TypeScript, testing, or build tools
- Example code provided clear implementation patterns

### 2. Tool Scaffolding ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Commands Used:**
```bash
mcp-server-kit add tool save-snippet --description "..."
mcp-server-kit add tool search-snippets --description "..."
mcp-server-kit add tool delete-snippet --description "..."
mcp-server-kit add tool tag-snippet --description "..."
```

**What Was Generated:**
1. ‚úÖ Tool file with TODO markers showing exactly where to implement
2. ‚úÖ Unit test file with test structure
3. ‚úÖ Integration test YAML with examples
4. ‚úÖ Auto-registration in `src/index.ts` (imports + function calls)

**TODO Markers Were Perfect:**
```typescript
// TODO: Define your parameter schema
// Example: const ParamsSchema = z.object({
//   message: z.string().describe("Your message"),
// });

// TODO: Implement your tool logic here
```

**Agent Benefit:**
- I never had to remember import syntax or registration patterns
- The TODO comments showed exactly what to implement
- Examples in comments were copy-pastable starting points

### 3. Prompt Scaffolding ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Commands:**
```bash
mcp-server-kit add prompt code-reviewer --description "..."
mcp-server-kit add prompt snippet-explainer --description "..."
```

**Critical Feature:**
The generated code explicitly warned about the string-only limitation:
```typescript
// NOTE: Prompt arguments MUST be strings only (SDK limitation)
// For boolean-like options, use comma-separated strings or enums
```

**Agent Benefit:**
- Prevented me from making the common mistake of using boolean args
- Clear examples showed the enum pattern for options
- Auto-registration worked perfectly

### 4. Resource Scaffolding ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Commands:**
```bash
mcp-server-kit add resource snippet --description "..."
mcp-server-kit add resource library-config --description "..."
```

**What I Liked:**
- CLI intelligently defaults to dynamic resources (ResourceTemplate)
- Generated code included list() and complete() callbacks
- TODO markers showed common patterns (KV, D1, external API)

**What Needed Clarification:**
- Not immediately obvious how to convert to static resource
- Had to manually remove ResourceTemplate wrapper for library-config

### 5. Example Files ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Files Included:**
- `_example-simple.ts` - Basic tool pattern
- `_example-validated.ts` - Validation patterns
- `_example-async.ts` - Async operations
- `_example-code-review.ts` - Complex prompt
- `_example-static.ts` - Static resource
- `_example-dynamic.ts` - Dynamic resource with ResourceTemplate

**Agent Benefit:**
- I referenced these files multiple times while implementing
- They showed real-world patterns, not toy examples
- Covered edge cases I might have forgotten

### 6. Skills Documentation ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Files in `.claude/skills/mcp-server-development/`:**
- `TOOLS.md` - Complete tool development guide
- `PROMPTS.md` - Prompt engineering patterns
- `RESOURCES.md` - Resource implementation with critical ResourceTemplate warnings
- `TESTING.md` - Test harness usage

**Standout Feature in RESOURCES.md:**
```markdown
## üö® CRITICAL: Static vs Dynamic Resources

### The #1 Most Common Mistake
**Problem:** Using `{variables}` in a plain string URI without `ResourceTemplate`
```

**Agent Benefit:**
- This saved me from the most common mistake!
- Visual comparison tables made the decision rule crystal clear
- I referenced this doc when implementing the snippet resource

### 7. Type Safety ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Experience:**
- TypeScript caught issues immediately
- Zod schemas prevented parameter mistakes
- No runtime type errors encountered

**Agent Benefit:**
- Confidence that code would work before running it
- Clear error messages when I made mistakes

### 8. Testing Infrastructure ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê¬Ω

**Unit Tests:**
- All generated tests passed immediately (45/45)
- Test structure was clear and extensible

**Integration Tests:**
- Declarative YAML format is brilliant for agents
- Easy to understand test specifications

**Only Issue:**
- Didn't actually run integration tests (would need dev server running)
- Unit tests were enough to validate logic

---

## Pain Points & Improvement Opportunities

### 1. Validation False Positives ‚≠ê‚≠ê (High Priority)

**Issue:**
```bash
‚ùå Tool "save-snippet" is not registered in src/index.ts
‚ùå Tool "save_snippet" is registered but file doesn't exist
```

**Reality:**
- All tools were correctly registered in `index.ts`
- File paths used kebab-case (`save-snippet.ts`)
- Registration detection logic has a bug

**Impact on Agent:**
- Confusing and time-consuming to debug
- Undermines trust in validation tool
- Makes me second-guess correct implementations

**Suggested Fix:**
1. Update validation logic to properly detect kebab-case registrations
2. Match import paths against actual file names
3. Add tests for validation logic itself

**Priority:** üî¥ HIGH - This actively confused me during development

### 2. mcp-server-kit in package.json ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Medium Priority)

**Issue:**
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "mcp-server-kit": "^1.0.0",  // ‚ùå Doesn't exist on npm
  ...
}
```

**Impact:**
- `npm install` failed immediately
- Had to manually edit package.json to proceed
- Breaks the "quick start" experience

**Suggested Fix:**
- Remove mcp-server-kit from scaffolded package.json
- Add note in README about installing mcp-server-kit globally
- Or: Document that it's meant to be installed globally only

**Priority:** üü° MEDIUM - Workaround is simple, but breaks first impression

### 3. ResourceTemplate Guidance Could Be Better ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**What Worked:**
- RESOURCES.md had excellent warnings about the #1 mistake
- Visual comparison table was very helpful

**What Could Improve:**
- CLI defaults to dynamic resources (ResourceTemplate)
- No guidance on when/how to convert to static
- I had to figure out the pattern myself

**Suggested Improvements:**
1. Add `--static` flag to `add resource` command
2. Generate different code based on flag
3. Add interactive prompt: "Is this resource dynamic (has variables)? [y/N]"

**Example:**
```bash
mcp-server-kit add resource config --static
# Generates static resource without ResourceTemplate

mcp-server-kit add resource user --dynamic
# Generates dynamic resource with ResourceTemplate and variable prompts
```

**Priority:** üü° MEDIUM - Documentation exists, but could be more seamless

### 4. Initial Validation Warning ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Issue:**
After scaffolding, validation shows:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è .mcp-template.json is missing tools array
```

**Impact:**
- Minor, but creates uncertainty about fresh scaffold
- Is this expected or did something go wrong?

**Suggested Fix:**
- Initialize `.mcp-template.json` with empty tools array
- Or: Suppress this warning for fresh scaffolds

**Priority:** üü¢ LOW - Doesn't block progress

### 5. No Direct CLI for Prompts/Resources Initially

**Observation:**
- I discovered `add prompt` and `add resource` existed
- But they're not mentioned in main README quick start
- Initially only saw `add tool` in documentation

**Suggested Fix:**
- Update README Quick Start to show all three:
  ```bash
  mcp-server-kit add tool <name>
  mcp-server-kit add prompt <name>
  mcp-server-kit add resource <name>
  ```

**Priority:** üü¢ LOW - Discoverability issue only
